# Finger-Counter
Computer Vision <br/>
<br/>

**Introduction** <br/>
This project is a Finger Counter built using OpenCV and a Hand Tracking Module inspired by Murtaza's YouTube Channel. The model detects a hand in the frame and counts the number of fingers being held up, displaying the count in real time. <br/>
<br/>

**Features** <br/>
* Real-Time Finger Counting: Detects and counts the number of fingers raised in the camera feed.
* Hand Detection: Utilizes a Hand Tracking Module to efficiently detect hands in the frame.
* OpenCV Integration: Uses OpenCV for image processing and video capture. <br/>
